          It's not his fault. I know you're going to want to, but you can't
          blame him. He really has no idea how it happened. I kept trying to
          come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when
          she found out what happened, but the more I tried, the more I could
          see none of them would work. He was going to get her wrath and there
          was nothing I could say to prevent it. He wandered down the stairs and
          into the basement. The damp, musty smell of unuse hung in the air. A
          single, small window let in a glimmer of light, but this simply made
          the shadows in the basement deeper. He inhaled deeply and looked
          around at a mess that had been accumulating for over 25 years. He was
          positive that this was the place he wanted to live. It was difficult
          to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually
          given him life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he
          actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less than a
          year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with
          his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.
          She tried not to judge him. His ratty clothes and unkempt hair made
          him look homeless. Was he really the next Einstein as she had been
          told? On the off chance it was true, she continued to try not to judge
          him. She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no
          desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She's
          resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to
          appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep
          insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here she
          sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called. “Ingredients for
          life,” said the backside of the truck. They mean food, but really food
          is only 1 ingredient of life. Life has so many more ingredients such
          as pain, happiness, laughter, joy, tears, and smiles. Life also has
          hard work, easy play, sleepless nights, and sunbathing by the ocean.
          Love, hatred, envy, self-assurance, and fear could be just down aisle
          3 ready to be bought when needed. How I wish I could pull ingredients
          like these off shelves in a store. Housework could be everyone’s work,
          not just “women’s work”. Why do women enable men to act oblivious to
          cleaning, grocery shopping, pet feeding, etc? Somehow when men live
          alone they figure out how to do all of those things all on their own.
          My friend’s husband claimed he didn’t know that sheets should be
          washed more than once a season. He said he didn’t know one had to
          clean toilets. He assumed that since you flush toilets they clean
          themselves. She tried to get him to help but he did an awful job so
          she let him off the hook. Wouldn’t it be better if she spent the time
          and energy to get him to do it right instead of letting him claim he
          is “just bad at it”. My sons were raised to clean toilets and change
          their own sheets. Hopefully, in their future homes, the housework will
          be equally divided. It was a simple tip of the hat. Grace didn't think
          that anyone else besides her had even noticed it. It wasn't anything
          that the average person would notice, let alone remember at the end of
          the day. That's why it seemed so unbelievable that this little gesture
          would ultimately change the course of the world. Debbie put her hand
          into the hole, sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach.
          She wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something, but all she felt
          was air. She shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch
          or two more down the hole. Her fingers still touched nothing but air.
          His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to say to
          them since they refused to believe the truth. He explained again and
          again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his
          imagination. There was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five
          years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden. Of
          course, it didn't help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the
          chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how he'd found it.
          Wandering down the path to the pond had become a daily routine. Even
          when the weather wasn't cooperating like today with the wind and rain,
          Jerry still took the morning stroll down the path until he reached the
          pond. Although there didn't seem to be a particular reason Jerry did
          this to anyone looking in from the outside, those who knew him well
          knew exactly what was going on. It could all be traced back to a
          specific incident that happened exactly 5 years previously. She didn't
          like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and
          started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different.
          Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just
          stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word. They
          argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's
          always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances,
          but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They
          both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the
          underlying issue. So they continue to argue. The blinking light caught
          her attention. She thought about it a bit and couldn't remember ever
          noticing it before. That was strange since it was obvious the flashing
          light had been there for years. Now she wondered how she missed it for
          that amount of time and what other things in her small town she had
          failed to notice. Terrance knew that sometimes it was simply best to
          stay out of it. He kept repeating this to himself as he watched the
          scene unfold. He knew that nothing good would come of him getting
          involved. It was far better for him to stay on the sidelines and
          observe. He kept yelling this to himself inside his head as he walked
          over to the couple and punched the man in the face. Breastfeeding is
          good for babies and moms. Infants that are breastfed get antibodies
          from their mothers against common illnesses. Breastfed babies have
          less chance of being obese as an adult. Breastfeeding a baby lets the
          infant-mother pair bond in a very unique way. Mother’s who breastfeed
          lower their chances of developing breast cancer. Usually, mothers who
          breastfeed lose their pregnancy weight more quickly and easily. The
          benefits of breastfeeding are numerous. A two-inch layer of freshly
          fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked outside. To most, it would
          have been a beautiful sight worthy of taking a photo to put on
          Instagram. For Stacey, it meant something different. The first snow of
          the year brought back the witches as the fairies in the yard had to
          seek shelter to avoid the cold. No matter how hard he tried, he
          couldn't give her a good explanation about what had happened. It
          didn't even really make sense to him. All he knew was that he froze at
          the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react, nothing in his
          body allowed him to move. It was as if he had instantly become a
          statue and although he could see what was taking place, he couldn't
          move to intervene. He knew that wasn't a satisfactory explanation even
          though it was the truth. It was that terrifying feeling you have as
          you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is
          something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at
          the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's where
          she found herself and she didn't know what to do next "Do Not Enter."
          The sign made it clear that they didn't want anyone around. That
          wasn't going to stop Jack. Jack always lived with the notion that
          signs were mere suggestions, not actually absolute rules. That's why
          the moment Jack looked at the "Do Not Enter" sign, he walked past it
          and onto their property. He walked down the steps from the train
          station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must
          be secured as quickly as possible. Bounding down the steps, he heard
          something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. There was nobody
          there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on the steps
          he had just come down. Had he past them without seeing them? It didn't
          seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep
          chill filled his body. Sometimes it's the first moment of the day that
          catches you off guard. That's what Wendy was thinking. She opened her
          window to see fire engines screeching down the street. While this
          wasn't something completely unheard of, it also wasn't normal. It was
          a sure sign of what was going to happen that day. She could feel it in
          her bones and it wasn't the way she wanted the day to begin. She sat
          in the darkened room waiting. It was now a standoff. He had the power
          to put her in the room, but not the power to make her repent. It
          wasn't fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness, she
          wouldn't change her attitude. At three years old, Sandy's stubborn
          personality had already bloomed into full view. Eating raw fish didn't
          sound like a good idea. "It's a delicacy in Japan," didn't seem to
          make it any more appetizing. Raw fish is raw fish, delicacy or not. It
          wasn't supposed to end that way. The plan had been meticulously
          thought out and practiced again and again. There was only one possible
          result once it had been implemented, but as they stood there the
          result wasn't anything close to what it should have been. They all
          blankly looked at each wondering how this could have happened. In
          their minds, they all began to blame the other members of the group as
          to why they had failed. To the two friends, the treehouse was much
          more than a treehouse. It was a sanctuary away from the other kids
          where they could be themselves without being teased or bullied. It was
          their secret fortress hidden high in the branches of a huge oak that
          only they knew existed. At least that is what they thought. They were
          more than a little annoyed when their two younger sisters decided to
          turn the treehouse into a princess castle by painting the inside pink
          and putting glitter everywhere. He read about a hike called the
          incline in the guidebook. It said it was a strenuous hike and to bring
          plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one
          review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not too bad of a
          workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in
          from Maryland on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness
          conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so I could
          handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a
          70-year-old low-lander. I checked in for the night at Out O The Way
          motel. What a bad choice that was. First I took a shower and a spider
          crawled out of the drain. Next, the towel rack fell down when I
          reached for the one small bath towel. This allowed the towel to fall
          halfway into the toilet. I tried to watch a movie, but the remote
          control was sticky and wouldn’t stop scrolling through the channels. I
          gave up for the night and crawled into bed. I stretched out my leg and
          felt something furry by my foot. Filled with fear, I reached down and
          to my surprise, I pulled out a raccoon skin pair of underwear. After
          my initial relief that it wasn’t alive, the image of a fat, ugly
          businessman wearing raccoon skin briefs filled my brain. I jumped out
          of the bed, threw my toothbrush into my bag, and sprinted towards my
          car. There wasn't a whole lot he could do at that moment. He played
          the situation again and again in his head looking at what he might
          have done differently to make the situation better. No matter how many
          times he relived the situation in his head, there was never really a
          good alternative course of action. There simply wasn't a whole lot he
          could have done in that particular moment. She had come to the
          conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears. The
          way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you
          wonderful insights into the person. Of course, she couldn't
          scientifically prove any of this, but that didn't matter to her.
          Before anything else, she would size up the ears of the person she was
          talking to.
